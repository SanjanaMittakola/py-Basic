# Decorator

### 1-Timing_Function_Execution.py
Write a decorator that measures the time a function takes to execute.
### 2-Debugging_Function_Calls.py
Create a decorator to print the function name and the values of its arguments every time the function is called.
### 3-Cache_Return_Values.py
Implement a decorator that caches the return values of a function, so that when it's called with the same arguments, the cached value is returned instead of re-executing the function.
